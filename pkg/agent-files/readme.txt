About
-------------------------
The File System Capacity Logical Disk plug-in monitor will return the used space for each of the drives listed in the 
LogicalDisk performance counter as a percent value on Windows system.

If desired, it is possible to ignore drives from being compared with the Exclude Drives field.  The list of drives 
should be comma delimited and can accept regular expressions, if desired. Because regular expression strings are 
accepted, instead of using the backslash when specifying Windows directories, use a forward slash.

For example, to ignore drives A:, L:, and the range of drives M:\Data1 to M:\Data5, enter A:,L:,M:/Data[1-5].
